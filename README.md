# Auto Render
"Auto render" renders the blender scene at each user-defined interval.

This add-on was created to save the modeling process, and seeks simplicity in handling.

Works on **Blender Version: 4.2.0** to **Blender 4.4.0**

## How to install

1. Download the [zipped file](https://github.com/victorictor/Auto-Render/releases/download/v1.2.4/Auto.Render.zip) or download the repository and zip it manually
   
1. In *Edit > Preferences > Addons* click __Install from Disk...__
   
1. Select the file named __Auto render.zip__ from the location where it was downloaded
   

After the addon appears in the list, check the box next to its name to activate it.

## How to use

1. On the right side of the 3D Viewport: __Sidebar (or “N-panel”)__ click on the __“Auto Render”__ tab
   
1. The Auto render tab will have __3 property widgets__ to configure
